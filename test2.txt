ITT thread we post stories of how in a game we somehow managed to survive something we shouldn't of, and kicked ass for a time on par with that of Big Boss.

>Level each one with a bolt action rifle
>Move to the next room to have another german turn into my face from the room
>I shive that nigger with my bayonet
>Pick up his Mp40 
>Go back toward the opposite entrance of the apartment building, come across the motherload of germans about 6-8 all in the same room, I guess part of a squad?
>Unleash hell with a full magazine killing every one.
>We capture the building.

I have no idea how he survived two people shooting at him. >play a game with /v/
>unfunny memes and reddit humor everywhere
>half of them always sound about 14 years old

why do you guys have to fail so fucking hard, seriously >play a game with /v/
>great discussions about vidya
>most are gentlemen and scholars
>always that one guy who's really good but never says anything

why do you guys have to be so fucking awesome, seriously >play game with /v/
>meme spamming everywhere
>people playing animeshit music
>xD US 4CHANNERS RIGHT. THAT FEEL I played Mechwarrior 4: Mercenaries with /v/ when it went free, and it was awesome.

We went around in a party to all the public games and there was teamwork seven ways from Sunday. In the hilly map I used to get in the mech with the huge ballistic slot that could fit the naval gauss cannon, then snipe people's legs out with that so our dudes with Longtoms could hit them with artillery and long-range missiles. We would sit in the hills doing this.

Other times, we would all grab power armor and run around with the huge damage but long-cooldown power armor drills, instagibbing mechs with a swarm of infantry. It was great. >play a few shitty korean grind-fest MMOs with /v/
>INTERNET NERD DRAMA EVERYWHERE
>CONSTANT BACKSTABBING BULLSHIT
>no one partying up and leveling like bros
>guild breaks up into 5 different small guild bullshit

Every single time. The only /v/ community I like is the DotA2 community, because at least these guys are decent human beings, 12 year olds reporting in >Everyone don't know what the fuck to do
>Everyone chop down EVERY FUCKING TREE ON SIGHT
>We fucking SWIM in wood
>They still fucking do it
>My face when

Don't get me wrong, I had ton of fun, but still, sometime it was like smashing my head against some walls. and want to win a few games. >dota 2 solo queue
>2 confirmed /v/irgins on my team
>they are obviously friends and they probably want us to know it because WOW THEY TALKED TO EACH OTHER ON VOICE CHAT THE ENTIRE GAME
>they are the most insufferable faggots that I have ever had the displeasure to play with
>literally the 'no fun allowed', 'I'm superior to you' assholes that you would expect when seeing all the different forms of hate on /v/
STAY HOMO, /V/ THERES A SIMPLE RULE OP

CONSOLE GAMES WITH /v/ SUCK BECAUSE CONSOLE CHILDREN ARE HORRIBLE IN GENERAL. I HAVE PLAYED QUITE A FEW CONSOLE GAMES WITH /v/ AND THEY HAVE ALL BEEN AWFUL.

CONVERSELY, PC GAMING WITH /v/ IS FUN AND WORTHWHILE AND THERE'S COMMUNITIES OF GUYS FROM HERE THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS NOW. FUCK, ONE IM IN IS COMING UP TO ITS 3RD BIRTHDAY SOON AND WE HAVEN'T KILLED EACH OTHER SO I GUESS YOU SHOULD SUCK MY DICK.
